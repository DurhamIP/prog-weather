#Week 12 Bench Test Scenario: Climate Data

The UK Met Office provides historical climate data from a number of weather stations around the uk <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-historic/#?tab=climateHistoric>

In preparation for the programming bench test which takes place during practical sessions of week 12 (i.e. second week of term 2, beginning 25/1/2016) you should try to implement the interfaces given. During the bench test itself you will adapt this code to solve some new problems, given by updated interfaces. You will have access to the code you have already written.

##Javadoc

Javadoc files for the interfaces have been created.
